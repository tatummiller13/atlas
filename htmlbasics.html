<h1>Basic HTML Animals</h1>

<p>This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.</p>

<h2>The Llama</h2>

<p>
  Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a web
  page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.
</p>

<h2>The Anaconda</h2>

<p>
  The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, traveling rapidly by way
  of anchors to sneak up on his prey.

<p>Turn the following directions into an ordered list.</p>

  <li>First knock on the door</li>
  <li>When prompted, say the magic word</li>

<h1>Emphasis and importance</h1>

<p>
   There are <strong>two</strong> things I care about -
  <strong>music</strong> and <strong>friends</strong>. Someday I
  <em>might</em> be able to get my friends interested in each other,
  <em>and</em> my music!
